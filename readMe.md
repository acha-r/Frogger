Frogger: A green block will be our frog until further notice. Guide it across without falling into water or getting hit by a car (blue and black box respectively)

Technologies used: HTML, CSS and Javascript
The aim of this and lots of other projects I have is to develop my Javascript skills so I have kept the styles simple to avoid getting distracted.
